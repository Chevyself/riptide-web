Riptide
===

Riptide is an animation project for the Drawing IV class at Universidad de Nariño. It is based in the song ["Riptide" by Vance Joy](https://open.spotify.com/track/3JvrhDOgAt6p7K8mDyZwRd). This web-page is made using [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/) and is going to be used in live presentations to redirect people to the song and author.
